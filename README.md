This is intended to be a submission to a coursera competition. The project is an analysis of the effectiveness of US post secondary institutions. 
The data is available at:

      Note that the data file contains the data for the most recent cohort.
      If you are interested in all preceding cohorts you can find the data at

Documentation for the data is available at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/.
Here, you can also download the data dictionary (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/CollegeScorecardDataDictionary.xlsx).

The data includes many variables such as: the location of the school, the average cost associated with going to that school, admission SAT scores, the demographic information about the students, etc. These data will be used to predict the earnings and the student debt realities of students that have graduated from the institutions.

As of Sept 17th, 2017 the goal has been exploring the data and creating R functions to do that quickly and easily. I am also exploring how to create my own classes and methods.
